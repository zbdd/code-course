# Programming Course

Welcome! This repository contains a set of step-by-step TypeScript lessons. Each lesson includes a guide and, for early lessons, a completed code sample you can run.

## Where to Start

1. Read the lesson guide in `lesson-001/README.md`.
2. Run the completed code in `lesson-001/completed/` to see the output.
3. Continue to `lesson-002/README.md` and `lesson-003/README.md`.

## Running a Lesson

Each completed lesson is a small, self-contained Node + TypeScript setup.

```bash
cd lesson-001/completed
npm install
node --import tsx main.ts
```

Repeat the same steps in `lesson-002/completed/`.

## Repository Layout

- `lesson-001/`, `lesson-002/`, `lesson-003/`: Lesson guides (`README.md`).
- `lesson-001/completed/`, `lesson-002/completed/`: Runnable code for the lesson.
- `docs/`: Supplemental lesson notes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (the lessons reference NVM for installation)
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands

## Need Help?

If you are stuck, re-read the current lesson guide and compare your work to the `completed/` folder for that lesson.
